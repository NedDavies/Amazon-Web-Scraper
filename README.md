# Amazon-Web-Scraper

## Code for Scraping Amazon Reviews

This application takes any Amazon URL and outputs the reviews of that product as a CSV with the name Amrevs~Product Title~.csv
It also turns all of the reviews into images for use in promotional material.

The GUI is not yet optimized as a user interface as this script was written as a personal tool, rather than as an application, but it does work.
