# Amazon-Web-Scraper

## Code for Scraping Amazon Reviews

This application takes any Amazon URL and outputs the reviews of that product as a CSV with the name Amrevs [Product Title].csv
It also turns all of the reviews into images for use in promotional material.

Please install the requirements, as well as the fonts and images to the same place as the .py file.

The GUI is not yet optimized as a user interface as this script was written as a personal tool, rather than as an application, but it does work.
