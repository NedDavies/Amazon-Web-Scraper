       "[\"\\n\\n  I gave this a 4 stars or 8/10.This was a great selection of festive stories all with a crime theme.  The stories were written by some well known crime writers including: Mark Billingham, Val McDermid, Rachael Blok, Heather Critchlow, Sara Collins (Goodreads Author), Elle Croft (Goodreads Author), James Delargy, Clare Empson, Jo Furniss (Goodreads Author), Sophie Hannah (Goodreads Author), T.E. Kinsey (Goodreads Author), N.J. Mackay, S.R. Masters (Goodreads Author), Phoebe Morgan (Goodreads Author), Dominic Nolan, Robert Scragg (Goodreads Author), Victoria Selman, Kate Simants (Goodreads Author), Adam Southward (Goodreads Author), Harriet Tyce (Goodreads Author).I bought this ebook from Amazon the profits from the book are being used to support frontline domestic abuse victims.I really enjoyed the stories and it's the sort of book that you can dip in and out of at random.  I binge read them though and as usual was reading more than one book at once.I can thoroughly recommend them and why not grab a copy to help support this worthy cause at the same time.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Rare it is, that I can say hand on heart that I enjoyed ALL stories in a collection. It\\'s why I tend not to buy too many unless an author has collected their own in one volume. However - what a pleasant surprise to discover that not only is this one contributing to good causes, but each and every story is a genuinely excellent example of \"less is more\" and offers some excellent (and festive, of course!) twisty, edge of your seat tales. I also discovered plenty of authors I\\'d not read before, so some new names to look out for in future, always an added bonus; so a success story in more ways than one for this collection.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  A great way to be introduced to some (for me) unfamiliar authors.  Lots of variety and all well written. This second anthology is to support victims of domestic abuse. I will be buying the first anthology, Afraid of the Light, which is for another good cause. Thank you to the writers and all others involved in producing such an entertaining book.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  These stories were drawn together for an important cause, and it was nice to see downtrodden women turn the tables in several of them. The central story, Heavenly Peace, was understated but very powerful. The Switch is a subtle story of a woman in the electric chair; a woman whose willpower has its own justice: brilliant! The very tender Charles Dickens themed story, in which we see the nighttime of London and a tormented soul exposed is superb. The brief Hunted cleverly shows how a surprising twist can be put in very little space. There are some very good stories in this collection, but I'm giving four stars as there was some drivel, like the Secret Santa story; and the opening story by Mark Billingham was disappointingly flat.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  A wonderful set of short stories which you can dip into as and when or sit and read until the end. I read them in a couple of sessions. A pretty good standard throughout and some new-to-me authors I’ll be checking out for their lengthier offerings. The book supports two good causes which allows the reader a small opportunity to do some good whilst enjoying a terrific set of short stories to read.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I want to give this five stars as the book is supporting a great cause. However, it’s a bit of a mixed bag with stories of varying quality.  There are one or two that are excellent, quite a few that are good but also some that are not that interesting and a couple that are just plain odd. On the plus side, it has sparked my curiosity in some of the authors - no bad thing really!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Loved this collection - there really is something for everyone and it's the perfect read to curl up with this Christmas. Scary, dark, funny, emotional - take your pick of these stories and it's all for a great cause too. Brilliant stuff.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I've got a list of TBR's on my Kindle, but, upon reading of this anthology, I had to purchase it.It's the perfect stocking filler and a great Christmas read and I enjoyed all the short stories. It's also really interesting to come across writers whose work is new to me.Definitely worth a read.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Loved this - so different yet fascinating. Read it in two sittings, staying up far too late! But it’s the sort of book you can return to repeatedly.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Sent me leaping into the festive spirit. As a reader and writer of crime fiction was the ideal way to IG night festive cheer in 2020!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Chilling festive delights! Certainly a different Christmas feel to these crime stories! Read (if you dare!)...Murderous acceptance and deceitful goings-on but difficult book to put down because you just want to read on and on and on and end up wanting more and more and more!Who'd have thought that crime sometimes pays...and especially during the season of peace and goodwill to all!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  With any anthology there are bound to be stories that grab you and others not. There were some real chilling treats in here though. Thoroughly enjoyable “festive” reading\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I loved every single story in this collection. There's something for everyone, and each of the stories offers a fresh new take on the festive theme. Plus, it's all for two brilliant charities!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  There is not a single dud in this collection. As ever, a great way to get to know new authors.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Don't usually read short stories but did enjoy this book. Donation was for a very good cause too. Well done.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Arrived quickly.  I enjoyed the stories very much.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  A lovely collection of short festive themed crime stories. Really enjoyable read and introduced me to some excellent new authors to look out for.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  A great collection of Christmas crime. Thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This anthology of short stories is written by eighteen different crime and thriller writers. Some are well known, others less so, but all the tales are themed around Christmas.If your thriller style is dark and twisted, try “Hunted” by Victoria Selman, a tightly constructed short story with a surprise ending. If you prefer your thrillers laced with humour, turn to “An Unexpected Present” by Phoebe Morgan. Mark Billingham’s “Under the Mistletoe Last Night” is more of a straightforward police procedural whereas, in complete contrast, the penultimate and movingly written “The Vigilante “ by Clare Empson is achingly sad.There really is something here for every reader and, as an added bonus, all the profits are being donated to Domestic Abuse charities. I have already recommended “Afraid of the Christmas Lights” to friends in my book group and plan to purchase one or two copies to place under the Christmas tree this year.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  This is a great little book to keep close to hand (or eye) during the lead up to/Christmas holidays, and all profits from Afraid Of The Christmas Lights will go to support two front-line charities* I was part of an advance readers group on the Pigeonhole Book Club that got early access to this anthology of short stories from some great crime writers, including Elle Croft, Mark Billingham, Phoebe Morgan, Val McDermid and Victoria Selman.  Not a huge fan of short stories usually, I feel that by their nature they don't really have enough time for plot or character development which can lead them to being quite predictable.However recently, during the Covid-19 pandemic I have found it harder to concentrate while reading (disaster!) and these little stories actually really helped, both by being short enough to hold my concentration, and good enough to kindle my interest, all the while impressing me with the punch they each packed in a limited number of words. One or two, in particular 'The Vigilante' by Clare Empson left me feeling like I had read an entire book centred around the main character and a special appearance from Mark Billingham's Tom Thorne also managed to cheer up a grey November day.Each of these little tales is very different in tone and style and one or two just didn't hit home for me, but, as they were so short, it didn't feel like I'd lost anything by spending the time to read them, as you might with a full novel - also, no pressure to add it to the dreaded 'did not finish' pile that all reviewers hate to consign a book to. The rest were various combinations of dark, scary, funny, chilling, sad, disturbing, sometimes predictable - sometimes not. All in all a really enjoyable mixed bag.At just £1.99 on Kindle at the moment, if you're a fan of crime stories you should really buy this book. And of course, the profits all go to the following charities, so even more reason to give it a try!ESDAS: Educates professionals, communities, victims and even perpetrators on the nature of domestic abuse. They offer practical measures, such as legal advice and transport, to enable survivors to find a safe place to live.Rights of Women: Helps women understand their legal rights and access a range of support services to which they are entitled.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Some of my favourite authors amongst these including Victoria Selman, Phoebe Morgan and James Delargy. I’ve selected a few of the ones I enjoyed the most to review.An Unexpected Present by Phoebe MorganI love the very dark humour in this story. Calmly wrapping up her dead husband in Christmas paper – ‘Marks and Spencer’s paper isn’t cheap’ she thinks, ‘I was glad I’d be able to put it to good use’, and worrying that ‘the turkey isn’t going to cook itself’.This was hilarious in that I just murdered my husband but I mustn’t let dinner spoil kind of way. Absolutely brilliant.Hunted by Victoria SelmanVictoria gives us another dark story but this one has a real twist at the end. Did you guess? Short and sweet.Especially at Christmas by Adam SouthwardThe darkest story of all. Even I struggled to find any humour in this one. Very clever and absolutely chilling.Fresh Meat by Elle CroftWe kind of all guessed what was going to happen but it didn’t matter. The moral of the tale is never mess with a crazy cat lady. And anyone on Pigeonhole knows that you NEVER mess with the cat. Loved this story.The Switch by James DelargyThis is so cleverly written. The narrator is telling us about a woman who killed her husband and two small children and is about to be executed. No humour here. He is talking to her in her last few moments before they pull the switch. The bit where they shave her head before she is electrocuted really got to me (I had to Google why they do this). This story stands out from all the others because it is so poignant and sad. I am a huge fan of this author and rightly so. So glad we got rid of the death penalty in this country years ago. It makes me shudder how they can still do this in some states of the US.A Dog is for Life, not just for Christmas by Robert ScraggUs Pigeons love a doggy tale just as much as we love a kitty tale (as long as the animals don’t get hurt) so this one was perfect. Never let your morals get in the way when someone hurts an animal. They must get their just desserts. Brilliant.The Vigilante by Clare EmpsonJust when I thought it couldn’t get any better, along comes my favourite. David loves Charles Dickens. A Victorian superhero. He also loves his wife. I read this story with tears in my eyes ( I admit I’ve been very emotional since hearing that the Bristol Zoo of my childhood memories is closing – well re-locating but that’s not the point). I digress. How beautiful and sad and totally original.Many thanks to The Pigeonhole and my fellow Pigeons for making this such an enjoyable read.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  When I say “Christmas” what do you think of?I think of endless queues, terrible songs, and mandatory gatherings. Or at least, I used to. This year, however, I decided to plan my kind of Christmas, and it started with my favorite authors and their extraordinary flair creating the perfect anthology to match my ideas of what the end of the year can be like!Earlier in the year, I reviewed Afraid of the Light, my very first anthology, and a real stable of the crime fiction genre to get or to offer. I said then how difficult I found to talk about an anthology, and I will say it again here!Afraid of the Christmas Light is not a book to get only and ONLY when you hate Christmas. No, no. The twist here is that each participant took something out of Christmas and turned it into something different, something new. The magic turned red. Literally!The assortment of stories is bound to make you feel. I went through it all: I got a bit scared, I got mad, I had “yikes” moments, but those short fiction pieces all have something in common: they are marvellously written.I dipped in and out of Afraid of the Christmas Lights, enjoying one or two stories at a time, relishing in the twisted Christmas tales I was receiving from authors I admire. The anthology could not have come at a better time, as it confirmed my opinion that you can choose your Christmas…Oh, this book was a lot of fun. No romance under the mistletoe, only bits of life (or death), literal or figurative, and always, always a special X factor from the authors.Under the Mistletoe Last Night by Mark BillinghamCount on Mr Billingham for opening this anthology with a bloody present under the Christmas tree! I found it to be both traditional and original. Yep, I like the contradiction!The Breadwinner by Sophie HannahA very special kind of gift! I was not expecting this but my verdict is: I loved it!Bad Guy by Kate SimantsThis story stirred the most disturbing feelings in me. It was raw and Kate just nailed it.An Unexpected Present by Phoebe MorganPhoebe Morgan’s writing is recognizable, it’s striking and twisted, one of my favorites!Just Kids by S.R. MastersDisturbing by its mundane subject and the reality injected in the story, I couldn’t stop reading. How many times have you had to deal with kids? Let S.R. Masters give you a lesson!Especially at Christmas by Adam SouthwardMy Pigs in Blankets! And so much more… I knew there was something off…The Bedminster Bird Burglaries by T.E. KinseyGood old police work! Again, an unexpected story, but so tasty!Fresh Meat by Elle CroftI love Elle Croft, and this story just made me love her more, even if I’m more of a dog person than a cat person…Heavenly Peace by Heather CritchlowOh, the family reunion, the smiles, the presents, the remarks, and the feast! The descriptions depicted something so familiar it was easy to create a movie of this story in my mind.The Switch by James DelargyMy stomach churned and I got goosebumps. Damn switch! Such an excellent piece!Secret Santa by Jo FurnissI know that Jo Furniss’s brain is wired in a way that she creates atmospheric and twisted stories that stay with me, and she proved just how good she is with this one! Not sure I’ll play Secret Santa again…A Dog is for Life, not just for Christmas by Robert ScraggThis story scared me. I am the kind of readers who ask for a trigger warning when animals are involved. I can’t read stories about cruelty on animals. I went in with a bit a fear… and finished it with a different kind of fear in mind!Driving Home for Christmas by Rachael BlokThe title sounds so comforting, filled with the promise of a happy reunion… Rachael wrote an particular kind of reunion. I won’t forget it!Smithereens by Dominic NolanWho knew being Santa could be dangerous? I really enjoyed this dark tale!Missteps by N.J. MackayOoooh, this one. I got so mad. Despite the lights and gifts, life is mean and unfair, or some people make it so, and my blood boiled. I remember thinking “I’ll give you Christmas! Ugh!” N.J. Mackay’s powerful story is a delightful punch in the stomach!The Vigilante by Clare EmpsonMy heart broke. My reader’s heart bled. Oh Clare!!!Hunted by Victoria SelmanYou can always count of Victoria Selman to surprise you. I was totally immersed in the story, holding my breath, assuming… when I should have known better!!!Bloody Christmas by Harriet TyceThe joys of Christmas… magically transformed by an author who knows what she’s doing!That’s it, I went through all the stories you’ll find in this anthology to give you a taste of what to expect. The flow of the full book is smooth and makes it really easy to jump from one movie to the other.I couldn’t be happier to be able to support the work those eighteen authors have done here to support two important charities: ESDAS and Rights of Woman. I urge you to treat you to a copy of this excellent anthology that is the reader’s equivalent of the best box of Christmas chocolates!\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I was given access to read this for free in advance via Pigeonhole in exchange for an honest review. As profits from the sale of the anthology are going to two front line domestic abuse charities I also donated to them directly.This is a well-rounded anthology of crime stories. All with a Christmas touch, although largely not Christmas stories. Given that it’s fundraising for domestic abuse charities many of the stories feature domestic abuse either overtly or subtly.Some stories are stronger than others. As with many short stories the strength often comes from how the ending is handled. On that basis, while it was great to read even a mini Tom Thorne tale, Mark Billingham’s contribution is one of the weaker entries.For me the best stories were:The Vigilante by Clare EmpsomCharles Dickens, a superhero protecting the vulnerable at night, true love and heartbreak. So much story in very few words. An excellent read.Driving Home for Christmas by Rachel BlokTwo brothers, very different in character. Both involved in car accidents on the same night. The connection between the two, once revealed, pulls a great family-focused plot together.A Dog Is For Life, Not Just For Christmas by Robert ScraggFunny with a very dark background story. Lola the dog gets the loving home she deserves in the end.Missteps by N.J. MackayWhile not the best story, it does have the most satisfying ending. Good if your like to see bad guys get their just deserts.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This is a collection of short crime stories, by various authors. Each has a Christmas connection, in some cases that is central to the story, in other cases it is incidental. The stories may be short, but they are powerful with plenty of unexpected twists. There is a lot of dark humour and observations of people’s habits/daily life.The overall quality of the writing was excellent, and the variety of styles is such that if there is one story that doesn’t appeal to you so much, the next surely will. There is something for everybody here & it’s a good introduction to some new writers as well as having content from old favourites.It must be noted that there are stories that centre on domestic abuse, so there does need to be a trigger warning, but all profits from the sale of this anthology will be donated to frontline domestic abuse charities.I read this book 2 stories a day over 9 days & that was perfect – it would be too easy to race through it & have the stories merge into one another, but dipping in & out allows each story to stand alone & shine for what it is.Disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book via ThePigeonhole. Whilst thanks go to the publisher & @ThePigeonHoleHQ for the opportunity to read this book, all opinions are my own. As I did not pay for the book, I felt it appropriate to make a donation to charity in lieu of the sale.#AfraidOfTheChristmasLights @ThePigeonholeHQ #BookReview\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Short but extremely powerful stories from established writers, some of whom I have come across before, and others I haven't.I don't usually read short stories, but when I do I am often pleasantly surprised and enjoy the clever way in which a whole story can be written with so few words! Occasionally I have read an anthology which has far from impressed me but with Afraid of the Christmas Lights I was bowled over by the punch each story had. Many were quite dark and many contained superb twists, and all of them had a link to the festive season.I would definitely recommend this book to others. If you like thrillers and crime reads and anything with a sense of the dark side of human nature, then this is a read which will counteract the sweetness of all those Christmas chocolates!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  I read this anthology of short crime stories all with a Christmas theme courtesy of Pigeonhole. All the profits from the sale go to frontline domestic abuse charities, so well worth buying.Some of the authors I had read before, but many I had not read and this was a nice introduction to some new writers. I hope to check out their other work later. The stories are a real mix of genres, with some very dark humour and some fun. They are all have some sort of a Christmas connection and you may never see Christmas in quite the same way again after reading these stories.Some of the stories are very current with references to face masks being warn and the pandemic evident. Not all of them were to my taste, but I did enjoy them all.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This is a marvellous showcase for its authors. I discovered writers that I am certainly going to read more from. There is a lot of variety in the stories and a consistently high quality of writing. I think it is safe to say that there is something for everyone. Whether you like Golden Age type stories, surprising twists, psychological crime novels or more quirky offerings. I was impressed by some very current settings with mentions of the pandemic. You should also be aware that this book raises money for domestic abuse charities. If you are looking for a gift, this could be just the thing. Also there is another anthology, \"Afraid of the Lights\" that came before this one.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  An excellent collection of short stories written by a group of extremely talented crime writers.  I LOVED the previous anthology \"Afraid of the Lights\" and this was just as good, if not better.The collection also raises money for domestic abuse charities so I am considering it as Christmas gifts for a few family/friends. There\\'s not one bad story and there are a real range of styles and plots. Even some humour too! Definitely something in here for everyone.Thanks to The Pigeonhole for access to this great book. I really hope there is another one in the works!\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  What a wonderful collection of short stories! The collection is like a favourite box of chocolates - each slightly different and none disappoint.

       " '\\n\\n  Great collection of Christmas short stories. There are stories by many of my favourite crime writers within this collection.I particularly enjoyed The Vigilante, Driving Home for Christmas, Heavenly Peace, An unexpected present and Underneath the Mistletoe Last Night - always nice to be reunited with Thorne. There’s not a terrible story in this anthology though.Buy a copy and enjoy a different kind of Christmas.\\n\\n',\n",

Jack Frost?\"\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  A surprising collection of Christmas crime stories, with a little something for everyone. Perfect to read one each day in the countdown to Christmas.

And it's for a good cause with the profits going to domestic abuse charities.\\n\\n\",\n",

Would recommend.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Bought for me as a Christmas present. A fascinating collection of vastly differing stories and styles. I really enjoyed the sharp twists and turns.

      "[\"\\n\\n  I gave this a 4 stars or 8/10.This was a great selection of festive stories all with a crime theme.  The stories were written by some well known crime writers including: Mark Billingham, Val McDermid, Rachael Blok, Heather Critchlow, Sara Collins (Goodreads Author), Elle Croft (Goodreads Author), James Delargy, Clare Empson, Jo Furniss (Goodreads Author), Sophie Hannah (Goodreads Author), T.E. Kinsey (Goodreads Author), N.J. Mackay, S.R. Masters (Goodreads Author), Phoebe Morgan (Goodreads Author), Dominic Nolan, Robert Scragg (Goodreads Author), Victoria Selman, Kate Simants (Goodreads Author), Adam Southward (Goodreads Author), Harriet Tyce (Goodreads Author).I bought this ebook from Amazon the profits from the book are being used to support frontline domestic abuse victims.I really enjoyed the stories and it's the sort of book that you can dip in and out of at random.  I binge read them though and as usual was reading more than one book at once.I can thoroughly recommend them and why not grab a copy to help support this worthy cause at the same time.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Rare it is, that I can say hand on heart that I enjoyed ALL stories in a collection. It\\'s why I tend not to buy too many unless an author has collected their own in one volume. However - what a pleasant surprise to discover that not only is this one contributing to good causes, but each and every story is a genuinely excellent example of \"less is more\" and offers some excellent (and festive, of course!) twisty, edge of your seat tales. I also discovered plenty of authors I\\'d not read before, so some new names to look out for in future, always an added bonus; so a success story in more ways than one for this collection.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A great way to be introduced to some (for me) unfamiliar authors.  Lots of variety and all well written. This second anthology is to support victims of domestic abuse. I will be buying the first anthology, Afraid of the Light, which is for another good cause. Thank you to the writers and all others involved in producing such an entertaining book.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  These stories were drawn together for an important cause, and it was nice to see downtrodden women turn the tables in several of them. The central story, Heavenly Peace, was understated but very powerful. The Switch is a subtle story of a woman in the electric chair; a woman whose willpower has its own justice: brilliant! The very tender Charles Dickens themed story, in which we see the nighttime of London and a tormented soul exposed is superb. The brief Hunted cleverly shows how a surprising twist can be put in very little space. There are some very good stories in this collection, but I'm giving four stars as there was some drivel, like the Secret Santa story; and the opening story by Mark Billingham was disappointingly flat.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  A wonderful set of short stories which you can dip into as and when or sit and read until the end. I read them in a couple of sessions. A pretty good standard throughout and some new-to-me authors I’ll be checking out for their lengthier offerings. The book supports two good causes which allows the reader a small opportunity to do some good whilst enjoying a terrific set of short stories to read.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I want to give this five stars as the book is supporting a great cause. However, it’s a bit of a mixed bag with stories of varying quality.  There are one or two that are excellent, quite a few that are good but also some that are not that interesting and a couple that are just plain odd. On the plus side, it has sparked my curiosity in some of the authors - no bad thing really!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Loved this collection - there really is something for everyone and it's the perfect read to curl up with this Christmas. Scary, dark, funny, emotional - take your pick of these stories and it's all for a great cause too. Brilliant stuff.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I've got a list of TBR's on my Kindle, but, upon reading of this anthology, I had to purchase it.It's the perfect stocking filler and a great Christmas read and I enjoyed all the short stories. It's also really interesting to come across writers whose work is new to me.Definitely worth a read.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Loved this - so different yet fascinating. Read it in two sittings, staying up far too late! But it’s the sort of book you can return to repeatedly.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Sent me leaping into the festive spirit. As a reader and writer of crime fiction was the ideal way to IG night festive cheer in 2020!\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Chilling festive delights! Certainly a different Christmas feel to these crime stories! Read (if you dare!)...Murderous acceptance and deceitful goings-on but difficult book to put down because you just want to read on and on and on and end up wanting more and more and more!Who'd have thought that crime sometimes pays...and especially during the season of peace and goodwill to all!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  With any anthology there are bound to be stories that grab you and others not. There were some real chilling treats in here though. Thoroughly enjoyable “festive” reading\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I loved every single story in this collection. There's something for everyone, and each of the stories offers a fresh new take on the festive theme. Plus, it's all for two brilliant charities!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  There is not a single dud in this collection. As ever, a great way to get to know new authors.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Don't usually read short stories but did enjoy this book. Donation was for a very good cause too. Well done.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Arrived quickly.  I enjoyed the stories very much.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A lovely collection of short festive themed crime stories. Really enjoyable read and introduced me to some excellent new authors to look out for.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A great collection of Christmas crime. Thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This anthology of short stories is written by eighteen different crime and thriller writers. Some are well known, others less so, but all the tales are themed around Christmas.If your thriller style is dark and twisted, try “Hunted” by Victoria Selman, a tightly constructed short story with a surprise ending. If you prefer your thrillers laced with humour, turn to “An Unexpected Present” by Phoebe Morgan. Mark Billingham’s “Under the Mistletoe Last Night” is more of a straightforward police procedural whereas, in complete contrast, the penultimate and movingly written “The Vigilante “ by Clare Empson is achingly sad.There really is something here for every reader and, as an added bonus, all the profits are being donated to Domestic Abuse charities. I have already recommended “Afraid of the Christmas Lights” to friends in my book group and plan to purchase one or two copies to place under the Christmas tree this year.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  This is a great little book to keep close to hand (or eye) during the lead up to/Christmas holidays, and all profits from Afraid Of The Christmas Lights will go to support two front-line charities* I was part of an advance readers group on the Pigeonhole Book Club that got early access to this anthology of short stories from some great crime writers, including Elle Croft, Mark Billingham, Phoebe Morgan, Val McDermid and Victoria Selman.  Not a huge fan of short stories usually, I feel that by their nature they don't really have enough time for plot or character development which can lead them to being quite predictable.However recently, during the Covid-19 pandemic I have found it harder to concentrate while reading (disaster!) and these little stories actually really helped, both by being short enough to hold my concentration, and good enough to kindle my interest, all the while impressing me with the punch they each packed in a limited number of words. One or two, in particular 'The Vigilante' by Clare Empson left me feeling like I had read an entire book centred around the main character and a special appearance from Mark Billingham's Tom Thorne also managed to cheer up a grey November day.Each of these little tales is very different in tone and style and one or two just didn't hit home for me, but, as they were so short, it didn't feel like I'd lost anything by spending the time to read them, as you might with a full novel - also, no pressure to add it to the dreaded 'did not finish' pile that all reviewers hate to consign a book to. The rest were various combinations of dark, scary, funny, chilling, sad, disturbing, sometimes predictable - sometimes not. All in all a really enjoyable mixed bag.At just £1.99 on Kindle at the moment, if you're a fan of crime stories you should really buy this book. And of course, the profits all go to the following charities, so even more reason to give it a try!ESDAS: Educates professionals, communities, victims and even perpetrators on the nature of domestic abuse. They offer practical measures, such as legal advice and transport, to enable survivors to find a safe place to live.Rights of Women: Helps women understand their legal rights and access a range of support services to which they are entitled.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Some of my favourite authors amongst these including Victoria Selman, Phoebe Morgan and James Delargy. I’ve selected a few of the ones I enjoyed the most to review.An Unexpected Present by Phoebe MorganI love the very dark humour in this story. Calmly wrapping up her dead husband in Christmas paper – ‘Marks and Spencer’s paper isn’t cheap’ she thinks, ‘I was glad I’d be able to put it to good use’, and worrying that ‘the turkey isn’t going to cook itself’.This was hilarious in that I just murdered my husband but I mustn’t let dinner spoil kind of way. Absolutely brilliant.Hunted by Victoria SelmanVictoria gives us another dark story but this one has a real twist at the end. Did you guess? Short and sweet.Especially at Christmas by Adam SouthwardThe darkest story of all. Even I struggled to find any humour in this one. Very clever and absolutely chilling.Fresh Meat by Elle CroftWe kind of all guessed what was going to happen but it didn’t matter. The moral of the tale is never mess with a crazy cat lady. And anyone on Pigeonhole knows that you NEVER mess with the cat. Loved this story.The Switch by James DelargyThis is so cleverly written. The narrator is telling us about a woman who killed her husband and two small children and is about to be executed. No humour here. He is talking to her in her last few moments before they pull the switch. The bit where they shave her head before she is electrocuted really got to me (I had to Google why they do this). This story stands out from all the others because it is so poignant and sad. I am a huge fan of this author and rightly so. So glad we got rid of the death penalty in this country years ago. It makes me shudder how they can still do this in some states of the US.A Dog is for Life, not just for Christmas by Robert ScraggUs Pigeons love a doggy tale just as much as we love a kitty tale (as long as the animals don’t get hurt) so this one was perfect. Never let your morals get in the way when someone hurts an animal. They must get their just desserts. Brilliant.The Vigilante by Clare EmpsonJust when I thought it couldn’t get any better, along comes my favourite. David loves Charles Dickens. A Victorian superhero. He also loves his wife. I read this story with tears in my eyes ( I admit I’ve been very emotional since hearing that the Bristol Zoo of my childhood memories is closing – well re-locating but that’s not the point). I digress. How beautiful and sad and totally original.Many thanks to The Pigeonhole and my fellow Pigeons for making this such an enjoyable read.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  When I say “Christmas” what do you think of?I think of endless queues, terrible songs, and mandatory gatherings. Or at least, I used to. This year, however, I decided to plan my kind of Christmas, and it started with my favorite authors and their extraordinary flair creating the perfect anthology to match my ideas of what the end of the year can be like!Earlier in the year, I reviewed Afraid of the Light, my very first anthology, and a real stable of the crime fiction genre to get or to offer. I said then how difficult I found to talk about an anthology, and I will say it again here!Afraid of the Christmas Light is not a book to get only and ONLY when you hate Christmas. No, no. The twist here is that each participant took something out of Christmas and turned it into something different, something new. The magic turned red. Literally!The assortment of stories is bound to make you feel. I went through it all: I got a bit scared, I got mad, I had “yikes” moments, but those short fiction pieces all have something in common: they are marvellously written.I dipped in and out of Afraid of the Christmas Lights, enjoying one or two stories at a time, relishing in the twisted Christmas tales I was receiving from authors I admire. The anthology could not have come at a better time, as it confirmed my opinion that you can choose your Christmas…Oh, this book was a lot of fun. No romance under the mistletoe, only bits of life (or death), literal or figurative, and always, always a special X factor from the authors.Under the Mistletoe Last Night by Mark BillinghamCount on Mr Billingham for opening this anthology with a bloody present under the Christmas tree! I found it to be both traditional and original. Yep, I like the contradiction!The Breadwinner by Sophie HannahA very special kind of gift! I was not expecting this but my verdict is: I loved it!Bad Guy by Kate SimantsThis story stirred the most disturbing feelings in me. It was raw and Kate just nailed it.An Unexpected Present by Phoebe MorganPhoebe Morgan’s writing is recognizable, it’s striking and twisted, one of my favorites!Just Kids by S.R. MastersDisturbing by its mundane subject and the reality injected in the story, I couldn’t stop reading. How many times have you had to deal with kids? Let S.R. Masters give you a lesson!Especially at Christmas by Adam SouthwardMy Pigs in Blankets! And so much more… I knew there was something off…The Bedminster Bird Burglaries by T.E. KinseyGood old police work! Again, an unexpected story, but so tasty!Fresh Meat by Elle CroftI love Elle Croft, and this story just made me love her more, even if I’m more of a dog person than a cat person…Heavenly Peace by Heather CritchlowOh, the family reunion, the smiles, the presents, the remarks, and the feast! The descriptions depicted something so familiar it was easy to create a movie of this story in my mind.The Switch by James DelargyMy stomach churned and I got goosebumps. Damn switch! Such an excellent piece!Secret Santa by Jo FurnissI know that Jo Furniss’s brain is wired in a way that she creates atmospheric and twisted stories that stay with me, and she proved just how good she is with this one! Not sure I’ll play Secret Santa again…A Dog is for Life, not just for Christmas by Robert ScraggThis story scared me. I am the kind of readers who ask for a trigger warning when animals are involved. I can’t read stories about cruelty on animals. I went in with a bit a fear… and finished it with a different kind of fear in mind!Driving Home for Christmas by Rachael BlokThe title sounds so comforting, filled with the promise of a happy reunion… Rachael wrote an particular kind of reunion. I won’t forget it!Smithereens by Dominic NolanWho knew being Santa could be dangerous? I really enjoyed this dark tale!Missteps by N.J. MackayOoooh, this one. I got so mad. Despite the lights and gifts, life is mean and unfair, or some people make it so, and my blood boiled. I remember thinking “I’ll give you Christmas! Ugh!” N.J. Mackay’s powerful story is a delightful punch in the stomach!The Vigilante by Clare EmpsonMy heart broke. My reader’s heart bled. Oh Clare!!!Hunted by Victoria SelmanYou can always count of Victoria Selman to surprise you. I was totally immersed in the story, holding my breath, assuming… when I should have known better!!!Bloody Christmas by Harriet TyceThe joys of Christmas… magically transformed by an author who knows what she’s doing!That’s it, I went through all the stories you’ll find in this anthology to give you a taste of what to expect. The flow of the full book is smooth and makes it really easy to jump from one movie to the other.I couldn’t be happier to be able to support the work those eighteen authors have done here to support two important charities: ESDAS and Rights of Woman. I urge you to treat you to a copy of this excellent anthology that is the reader’s equivalent of the best box of Christmas chocolates!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I was given access to read this for free in advance via Pigeonhole in exchange for an honest review. As profits from the sale of the anthology are going to two front line domestic abuse charities I also donated to them directly.This is a well-rounded anthology of crime stories. All with a Christmas touch, although largely not Christmas stories. Given that it’s fundraising for domestic abuse charities many of the stories feature domestic abuse either overtly or subtly.Some stories are stronger than others. As with many short stories the strength often comes from how the ending is handled. On that basis, while it was great to read even a mini Tom Thorne tale, Mark Billingham’s contribution is one of the weaker entries.For me the best stories were:The Vigilante by Clare EmpsomCharles Dickens, a superhero protecting the vulnerable at night, true love and heartbreak. So much story in very few words. An excellent read.Driving Home for Christmas by Rachel BlokTwo brothers, very different in character. Both involved in car accidents on the same night. The connection between the two, once revealed, pulls a great family-focused plot together.A Dog Is For Life, Not Just For Christmas by Robert ScraggFunny with a very dark background story. Lola the dog gets the loving home she deserves in the end.Missteps by N.J. MackayWhile not the best story, it does have the most satisfying ending. Good if your like to see bad guys get their just deserts.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is a collection of short crime stories, by various authors. Each has a Christmas connection, in some cases that is central to the story, in other cases it is incidental. The stories may be short, but they are powerful with plenty of unexpected twists. There is a lot of dark humour and observations of people’s habits/daily life.The overall quality of the writing was excellent, and the variety of styles is such that if there is one story that doesn’t appeal to you so much, the next surely will. There is something for everybody here & it’s a good introduction to some new writers as well as having content from old favourites.It must be noted that there are stories that centre on domestic abuse, so there does need to be a trigger warning, but all profits from the sale of this anthology will be donated to frontline domestic abuse charities.I read this book 2 stories a day over 9 days & that was perfect – it would be too easy to race through it & have the stories merge into one another, but dipping in & out allows each story to stand alone & shine for what it is.Disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book via ThePigeonhole. Whilst thanks go to the publisher & @ThePigeonHoleHQ for the opportunity to read this book, all opinions are my own. As I did not pay for the book, I felt it appropriate to make a donation to charity in lieu of the sale.#AfraidOfTheChristmasLights @ThePigeonholeHQ #BookReview\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Short but extremely powerful stories from established writers, some of whom I have come across before, and others I haven't.I don't usually read short stories, but when I do I am often pleasantly surprised and enjoy the clever way in which a whole story can be written with so few words! Occasionally I have read an anthology which has far from impressed me but with Afraid of the Christmas Lights I was bowled over by the punch each story had. Many were quite dark and many contained superb twists, and all of them had a link to the festive season.I would definitely recommend this book to others. If you like thrillers and crime reads and anything with a sense of the dark side of human nature, then this is a read which will counteract the sweetness of all those Christmas chocolates!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I read this anthology of short crime stories all with a Christmas theme courtesy of Pigeonhole. All the profits from the sale go to frontline domestic abuse charities, so well worth buying.Some of the authors I had read before, but many I had not read and this was a nice introduction to some new writers. I hope to check out their other work later. The stories are a real mix of genres, with some very dark humour and some fun. They are all have some sort of a Christmas connection and you may never see Christmas in quite the same way again after reading these stories.Some of the stories are very current with references to face masks being warn and the pandemic evident. Not all of them were to my taste, but I did enjoy them all.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  This is a marvellous showcase for its authors. I discovered writers that I am certainly going to read more from. There is a lot of variety in the stories and a consistently high quality of writing. I think it is safe to say that there is something for everyone. Whether you like Golden Age type stories, surprising twists, psychological crime novels or more quirky offerings. I was impressed by some very current settings with mentions of the pandemic. You should also be aware that this book raises money for domestic abuse charities. If you are looking for a gift, this could be just the thing. Also there is another anthology, \"Afraid of the Lights\" that came before this one.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  An excellent collection of short stories written by a group of extremely talented crime writers.  I LOVED the previous anthology \"Afraid of the Lights\" and this was just as good, if not better.The collection also raises money for domestic abuse charities so I am considering it as Christmas gifts for a few family/friends. There\\'s not one bad story and there are a real range of styles and plots. Even some humour too! Definitely something in here for everyone.Thanks to The Pigeonhole for access to this great book. I really hope there is another one in the works!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  What a wonderful collection of short stories! The collection is like a favourite box of chocolates - each slightly different and none disappoint. Although some of the stories were quite dark, many raised a smile and the odd chuckle. Perfect for an evening of reading. Thanks to The Pigeonhole for introducing me to this collection.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Great collection of Christmas short stories. There are stories by many of my favourite crime writers within this collection.I particularly enjoyed The Vigilante, Driving Home for Christmas, Heavenly Peace, An unexpected present and Underneath the Mistletoe Last Night - always nice to be reunited with Thorne. There’s not a terrible story in this anthology though.Buy a copy and enjoy a different kind of Christmas.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Read and enjoyed via the Pigeonhole, huge thanks to them & authors for enabling.This was an anthology of Christmas themed tales/short stories, often very \"noir\" by several well known crime authors.I don\\'t think there was a \"bad\" one enjoyed all of them which is highly unusual but not a great surprise given experience of the previous anthology \"Afraid of the Light\".Highly recommend plus it\\'s for Charity.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I was fortunate to receive a copy of this Ebook from Pigeonhole in exchange for my honest review.I really liked this book! There are some very dark Christmas stories but also some very funny moments. All of the stories are from great authors and its a definite alternative to traditional Christmas novels!My favourite quote:\"Who the hell would do Santa in? The tooth fairy? Jack Frost?\"\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  A surprising collection of Christmas crime stories, with a little something for everyone. Perfect to read one each day in the countdown to Christmas. The stories Bad Guy by Kate Simants and The Vigilante by Clare Empson have lingered long in my mind despite being short and sweet. But each tale is different. And it's for a good cause with the profits going to domestic abuse charities.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n  I'm not a great lover of short stories but I thoroughly enjoyed all of these...a perfect book to dip in and out of during the busy holiday season! There were one or two that really stood out to me but they all were interesting and varied. With thanks to the Pigeonhole and all the authors for the privilege of reading alongside my fellow Pigeons.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  I read this collection of short stories courtesy of The Pigeonhole. I wouldn’t normally choose to read short stories but I thoroughly enjoyed these. There are some well known authors in here and I was never quite sure at the start of each story whether I was going to get beautiful and lovely, dark, twisted or just a little odd! Would recommend.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Bought for me as a Christmas present. A fascinating collection of vastly differing stories and styles. I really enjoyed the sharp twists and turns. I found that reading one or at most two stories a day fired my imagination for the rest of the day. All for the benefit of helping to protect women. I now plan to look at the other book “Afraid of the light.”\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  Just ordered this anthology as a Christmas present and then found myself totally engrossed so I've had to order more!With writing from some of the best known authors - Sophie Hannah, Mark Billingham - and other names I hadn't yet discovered, this is a really gripping collection. The stories are very different - there's a girl on the run, a drunken Santa Claus, casual murder under the Christmas tree and Harriet Tyce writes a prequel to her fantastic debut Blood Orange. I enjoyed every single one.Makes a perfect, affordable Christmas present and supports two domestic abuse charities at the same time.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  This anthology puts a much darker emphasis to the Christmas story genre.  Each story is so different, some have humour, some are thoughtful, some murderous.  Each story in this collection is by a different author, but all make for great reading.Thanks to the authors, and to Pigeonhole for the opportunity to read this collection of stories set in and around Christmas.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Probably 3 1/2 if we were allowed to give ‘half’ stars.  A bit of a mixture but the good and very good outnumbered the ‘so-so’.  One or two seemed familiar but can’t imagine that I have read them anywhere else.  Not all blood and gore, just a great selection of Christmas oddities.  Thank you Pigeonhole.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I don't normally like a book of short stories but this one was brilliant.  Lots of quirky Christmas tales that you could read one a day and get into the Christmas spirit!  I really enjoyed it.  Thank you to Pigeonhole HQ for allowing me to read this in staves.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  Enjoyed these short stories so much. Some short, some dark, some funny, all brilliant.Included handy links to the authors other work and a bio about them.Also brilliant is the proceeds going to a domestic abuse charity, so buy it up!\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  I read this in staves via pigeonhole. This was a good read. I enjoyed some more than others but lots of variety and lots of twists and turns.I think the short story format enabled me to really appreciate the quality of the writing.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Thoroughly enjoyed this collection, my personal favourites were probably the more gruesome dark but funny stories early on in the book, but I enjoyed the others too, some great tales of revenge amongst others. Am off to buy the first collection now as I wasn’t aware of it before. Hope there are more to come :)\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Thanks to Pigeonhole for a review copy of this book.A distinctive collection of dark short stories with a Christmas backdrop. Profits go to Domestic abuse charities. Definitely worth a look.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Brilliant collection of short stories. I loved every one. Some from authors I have read before but a couple of new authors to me and I will be looking out for more of their work.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  There are some fab short stories in this anthology. There was only one that I disliked.Thanks to Pigeonhole for the read.All money raised for this goes to charity\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Loved this varied anthology of short stories by some of our most exciting contemporary authors face paced and thrilling with a theme not only of Christmas but also of death...\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  A mixed collection of dark tales, (some very dark indeed) , mostly deliciously black with a twist, and all very cleverly written. An antidote to Christmas smaltz.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  Absolutely brilliant book of varying short stories. I don’t usually enjoy short stories but most of these felt like I had read a complete book! Highly recommended\\n\\n', '\\n\\n  *Thank you to Pigeonhole *Really good anthology that I enjoyed reading.

Each story has something new and chilling to say, all in pocket-sized chunks with a mix of fantastic characters and interesting stories. And the fact that the profits all go to charity is amazing.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n  I was lucky enough to read this via The Pigeonhole. And what a great collection of stories it is. Festive, fun, dark and definitely page-turning. And for a fantastic cause. I've just bought a copy of the paperback so that I can go back and read again this Christmas and for Christmases to come!\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n  A really great selection of Christmas stories!
